I am currently a student from MS in Statistics and Data Science program at Yale University. I graduated from Nanjing University in 2023 majoring in Statistics. I have interests in machine learning theory and applications. Theoretically, I would like to study under what conditions, machine learning methods can work well and how to design new learning procedure for different scenarios. For the aspect of applications, I am interested at large-scale implementations of machine learning methods and their applications to practical problems. 

Please also see my current [CV](https://github.com/zh-qifan/CV-and-Notes/blob/main/Qifan_CV.pdf) and some of my notes.
