In this post, I want to give an intuitive understanding on its proof to illustrate why it constructs a set like that and what it is doing.
Jordan-Hahn decomposition states as follows,
Let $\nu$ be a signed measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$. Then it has a decomposition $$\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^- $$ where $$ \nu^+(A) = \sup \{\nu(B)|B\subset A, B \in \mathcal{F}\} $$$$ \nu^-(A) = \sup \{-\nu(B)|B\subset A, B \in \mathcal{F}\} $$ and both $\nu^+$ and $\nu^-$ are measure and one of them is a finite measure.</description></item><item><title>A Mistake on Composition of Measurable Function</title><link>https://zh-qifan.github.io/blog/20220929-mistake-measurable-functions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zh-qifan.github.io/blog/20220929-mistake-measurable-functions/</guid><description>In abstract measure theory, we have one proposition about the composition of measurable function. Suppose $(\Omega_1,\Sigma_1)$, $(\Omega_2,\Sigma_2)$ and $(\Omega_3,\Sigma_3)$ are measurale spaces, and $f:(\Omega_1,\Sigma_1) \rightarrow (\Omega_2,\Sigma_2)$ and $g:(\Omega_2,\Sigma_2) \rightarrow (\Omega_3,\Sigma_3)$ are measurable functions. Then $g\circ f$ is a measurable function from $(\Omega_1,\Sigma_1)$ to $(\Omega_3,\Sigma_3)$.
The proof of this proposition is trivial. But one thing confused me: in Lebesgue measure theory, we have a proposition that composition of a real-valued continuous function and a real-valued measurable function is measurable but the opposite (composition of a measurable function and a continuous function is measurable) is not right.</description></item></channel></rss>
