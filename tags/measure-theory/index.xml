In this post, I want to give an intuitive understanding on its proof to illustrate why it constructs a set like that and what it is doing.
Jordan-Hahn decomposition states as follows,
Let $\nu$ be a signed measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$. Then it has a decomposition $$\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^- $$ where $$ \nu^+(A) = \sup \{\nu(B)|B\subset A, B \in \mathcal{F}\} $$$$ \nu^-(A) = \sup \{-\nu(B)|B\subset A, B \in \mathcal{F}\} $$ and both $\nu^+$ and $\nu^-$ are measure and one of them is a finite measure.</description></item></channel></rss>
