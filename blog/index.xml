Every function can be written as sum of an odd function and an even function. Find a one-to-one mapping between $\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{Z}^+$. ($2k$ and $2k+1$) $0.99999\cdots&amp;lt; 1$?

You are allow to weigh 3 times to find the defective and also tell which weighs less or more.
The above is a question on A Practical Guid to Quantitative Finance Interview. The book gives a more general answer to this book without any explanation &amp;ndash; you can identify the defective ball among up to $(3^n - 3) / 2$ balls using no more than $n$ measurements.</description></item><item><title>An intuitive understanding of the proof for Jordan-Hahn decomposition</title><link>https://zh-qifan.github.io/blog/20221030-jordan-hahn-thm/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zh-qifan.github.io/blog/20221030-jordan-hahn-thm/</guid><description>Jordan-Hahn decomposition is one of the most important theorem in measure theory but its proof is both lengthy and hard to understand, at least for beginners. In this post, I want to give an intuitive understanding on its proof to illustrate why it constructs a set like that and what it is doing.
Jordan-Hahn decomposition states as follows,
Let $\nu$ be a signed measure on $(\Omega, \mathcal{F})$. Then it has a decomposition $$\nu = \nu^+ - \nu^- $$ where $$ \nu^+(A) = \sup \{\nu(B)|B\subset A, B \in \mathcal{F}\} $$$$ \nu^-(A) = \sup \{-\nu(B)|B\subset A, B \in \mathcal{F}\} $$ and both $\nu^+$ and $\nu^-$ are measure and one of them is a finite measure.</description></item><item><title>Why does Jackknife method works?</title><link>https://zh-qifan.github.io/blog/20221008-jackknife-intro/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zh-qifan.github.io/blog/20221008-jackknife-intro/</guid><description>In the Advanced Mathematical Statistics course in Spring AY21/22, we studied two popular model-free computational methods used in estimation: Jackknife and Bootstrap. Given $n$ observations $X_1,\cdots, X_n$ and a statistics $T_n$ as the estimation for unknown parameter $\theta$ (e.g. mean value and variance), the Jackknife method for bias estimation formulates as follows, $$ b_{JACK} = (n - 1)(\bar{T}_{n-1} - T_n) $$ where $\bar{T}_{n-1} = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n T_{n-1,i} = n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^n T_{n-1}(X_1,\cdots,X_{i-1},X_{i+1},\cdots,X_n)$ represents the estimator generated by $n-1$ observations in our full dataset.</description></item><item><title>A Mistake on Composition of Measurable Function</title><link>https://zh-qifan.github.io/blog/20220929-mistake-measurable-functions/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Sep 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://zh-qifan.github.io/blog/20220929-mistake-measurable-functions/</guid><description>In abstract measure theory, we have one proposition about the composition of measurable function. Suppose $(\Omega_1,\Sigma_1)$, $(\Omega_2,\Sigma_2)$ and $(\Omega_3,\Sigma_3)$ are measurale spaces, and $f:(\Omega_1,\Sigma_1) \rightarrow (\Omega_2,\Sigma_2)$ and $g:(\Omega_2,\Sigma_2) \rightarrow (\Omega_3,\Sigma_3)$ are measurable functions. Then $g\circ f$ is a measurable function from $(\Omega_1,\Sigma_1)$ to $(\Omega_3,\Sigma_3)$.
The proof of this proposition is trivial. But one thing confused me: in Lebesgue measure theory, we have a proposition that composition of a real-valued continuous function and a real-valued measurable function is measurable but the opposite (composition of a measurable function and a continuous function is measurable) is not right.</description></item></channel></rss>
